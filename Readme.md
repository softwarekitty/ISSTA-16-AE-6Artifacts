##Artifacts prepared for ISSTA-16-AE-6

The tools in this repo can be used to recreate the results published in the ISSTA-16 paper, [**Exploring Regular Expression Usage and Context in Python**](https://github.com/softwarekitty/ISSTA-16-AE-6Artifacts/blob/master/pdf/comingSoon.pdf).

######This code does not mine GitHub for Python regexes.

Contents of important folders are described below:
____

####```artifacts```

The artifacts folder contains key objects used in recreating the results of the paper:

- **merged_report.db** is an SQLite3 database file containing all the data mined from GitHub.
- **projectInfo.txt** contains a list of the projects mined for regexes (only those that contained regexes are included).
- **fullCorpus.txt** is a dump of all the patterns (and the project sets associated with them) from the corpus in the paper.
- **featureStats.tex** is the .tex table that displays feature statistics for regexes in the corpus.
- ```testStrings``` is a folder containing all the strings generated by Rex used to build the input for mcl
- **filteredCorpus.txt** is a file containing the regexes supported by Rex, used in the analysis.
- **similarityMatrix.abc** is the input for mcl.  It represents the weighted, undirected edges of the similarity matrix.
- **behavioralSimilarClusters_i1.80_p0.75_k83.txt** is the custer specification produced by mcl.
- **behaviralSimilarityClusterDump_i1.80_p0.75_k83.txt** is the more human-readable content containing clusters.

####```src/recreateArtifacts```

Source code to reproduce the artifacts is in the src folder.  Instructions for how to reproduce the artifacts are in the following paths:
-```miningDataSources``` generates the *projectInfo.txt* file from the database.
-```corpus``` generates the *fullCorpus.txt* file from the database.
-```featureTable``` generates *featureStats.tex* from *filteredCorpus.txt*.  This step may be reusable for appropriate [inputs](#inputs).
-```similarityMatrix``` contains a program that transforms the *filteredCorpus.txt* and contents of ```testStrings``` into the *similarityMatrix.abc* file.
-```clusters``` contains a program that runs [mcl](http://micans.org/) on the similarityMatrix.abc input to generate the two behavioral similarity files.


>Note that at this time, we do not have a convenient way to recreate the contents of the ```testStrings``` folder, or *filteredCorpus.txt*, which both use Rex.  The inconvenient way, which we used, is to install .Net 4.5, Rex and VisualStudio on a Windows 7 installation, and incrementally run Rex using the code in the ```csharp``` folder of the [tour_de_source](https://github.com/softwarekitty/tour_de_source) repository after setting up various path variables within that csharp code.

####```src/main``` and ```src/test```

These folders contain the core code used to reason about regular expressions, and the test suite protecting and specifying that code.


_____

####Set up Eclipse, jars and home_path


1. Create a Java Project in Eclipse (use Java 1.7) using this repo as the project directory.
2. Add the jar files in the `lib` directory to the build path.
3. To run tests of the core code, set up JUnit4.

_____

####Inputs
A tab-separated-values (tsv) file with Python patterns and a CSV list of project IDs, like:

```
"ab*c"  1,2
"(?:\\d+)\.(\\d+)"   2,3,5
u'[^a-zA-Z0-9_]' 1,5
'^[-\\w]+$' 2
'^\\s*\\n'  1,3,4
```

At this time, all patterns must be followed by a tab and at least one project ID.

Patterns should be valid in Python - raw Python Strings are not supported at this time.

No extra lines or whitespace in input files, please.  No dulplicate patterns, please.

##F.A.Q.
####why Python?
It was not an arbitrary choice, but it was not the only option, either.  JavaScript would have been a reasonable alternative using our rationalle.  Consider first that regular expression languages have different feature sets, and doing this analysis takes some time.  In order to maximize the impact of the research, we wanted a language that *includes* common features (features shared by other languages) and *excludes* rare features (features not shared by many other languaes).  Python fits this description, as can be seen by looking at [a comparison of language feature sets](https://github.com/softwarekitty/ISSTA-16-AE-6Artifacts/pdf/blob/master/languageTables.pdf) from [my thesis](https://github.com/softwarekitty/ISSTA-16-AE-6Artifacts/pdf/blob/master/thesis.pdf).

####where is the mining code?
It can be found in the [tour_de_source](https://github.com/softwarekitty/tour_de_source) repo, but it is not groomed for public consumption, and is probably not an optimal mining solution.

####why not use formal tools for behavioral analysis?
Because the tools we found cannot handle regexes using certain common features, like '$'.

####how can I submit an error report, bug report or pull requrest?
Please open an issue if you find any problems or want to be a contributor.
