##Recreate feature table

######Input: *fullCorpus.tsv*

######Output: *featureStats.tex*

##Program Summary

When run, this program recreates Table 4 from the paper (as a standalone tex document, as requested by reviewers).

####Possible Re-Use
A properly formatted input could be exchanged for the input being used by the table builder, and then the relevant feature usage stats for that data would be created when this program is run.  Several commented-out fields can be restored, displaying or hiding a few different views on the features used by a set of regexes.
