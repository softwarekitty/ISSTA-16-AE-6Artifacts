##Recreate feature table

######Input: *fullCorpus.tsv*

######Output: *featureStats.tex*

When run, this program recreates Table 4 from the paper (as a standalone tex document, as requested by reviewers).

A properly formatted input could be exchanged for the input being used by the table builder and the relevant feature usage stats for that data would be created.  Several commented-out fields can be restored, displaying or hiding a few different views on the features used by an input.
